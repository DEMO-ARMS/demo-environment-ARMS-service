Hello! Welcome to an example of a GitHub Repository.  This is a free, secure and most importantly a legacy proof platform that could be used to hold all or any documents that the National Development Network feel suitable.

The lay out of GitHub can feel a bit confusing at first, as it's more often used by data scientists or coders, but it's not too dissimilar from the windows explorer folder system once you get used to it. Have a play around with this environment and see whether you think it can be used as a solution for the network's need for a shared space. 

Any feedback, comments, or questions are greatly welcomed.  I can be reached by c.chrzanowski@uea.ac.uk or Chris.Chrzanowski@Southernhealth.nhs.uk

Enjoy!
